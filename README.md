**Automated Backups**  
Easily schedule MySQL database backups via crontab.

## Installation

**Download the script**
```sh
wget https://github.com/qcybb/mysqlbackup-plus/raw/main/mysqlbackup-plus.sh
```

**Set Executable Permissions**
```sh
chmod +x mysqlbackup-plus.sh
```

**Add the script to Crontab** (run daily at 3AM)
```sh
0 3 * * * /path/to/mysqlbackup-plus.sh
```
If you prefer not to receive email notifications with the backup status information, you can suppress them by doing:
```sh
0 3 * * * /path/to/mysqlbackup-plus.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Setup
**Create a .my.cnf file**  
This method enhances security by preventing your MySQL credentials from being exposed in command history.
```sh
nano ~/.my.cnf
```
**Add MySQL credentials to the file**
```sh
[client]
user=mysql_user_name
password=mysql_password
```
**Save and exit**  
```sh
If using nano, press CTRL + X, then Y, and Enter.
```

**Set file permissions** (to prevent unauthorized access)
```sh
chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf
```

## Customize Your Setup
Modify the `mysqlbackup-plus.sh` file to configure settings based on your needs.
